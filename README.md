## Code Explanation

The code is structured as follows:

1. Necessary libraries and dependencies are included.
2. Constants are defined, including take profit, stop loss, and lot size.
3. Global variables are defined, including a trade object and an array to store calculated levels.
4. Helper functions are defined to calculate levels, place pending orders, monitor market conditions, implement risk management measures, execute trades, and provide real-time updates.
5. The entry point of the EA is the `OnTick()` function, which calls the helper functions in the appropriate order.

The `CalculateLevels()` function calculates the pivot level, first support level, and first resistance level using the Pivot Point system. These levels are then stored in the `levels` array.

The `PlacePendingOrders()` function loops through the `levels` array and places sell stop and buy stop orders at the specified prices.

The `MonitorMarketConditions()` function is a placeholder for user-defined logic to monitor market conditions and adjust the trading strategy accordingly.

The `ImplementRiskManagement()` function sets the deviation in points for pending orders, as well as the stop loss and take profit levels.

The `ExecuteTrades()` function is a placeholder for user-defined logic to execute trades based on predefined rules and conditions.

The `ProvideUpdates()` function is a placeholder for user-defined logic to provide real-time updates on trade positions and performance.

In the `OnTick()` function, the helper functions are called in the appropriate order to calculate levels, place pending orders, monitor market conditions, implement risk management measures, execute trades, and provide updates.

Please note that the code provided is a sample and may require customization and additional logic to suit specific trading strategies and preferences.
